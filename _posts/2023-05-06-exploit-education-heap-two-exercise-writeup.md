### Quick Overview

Similar to Heap One, Heap Two exercise motive is to leverage buffer overflow and perform UAF (**User-After-Free Vulnerability**) that technically allows to re-use the allocated memory in the heap to control the program flow. Similar to `gets` in Heap Zero, `strdup` function is unsafe that doesn't have bounds check, it accepts memory address to copy but doesn't care about overwriting other declared struct variable in the heap region.

### Disassemble

Disassembling the code will get you overall idea behind the heap-two code, One can use `gdb ./heap-two` to start debugging it in runtime.

1. `gdb ./heap-two`
2. Type `disassemble main` to get the disassembled code (assembly)

```assembly

Before taking a look at the code, if you disassembled the heap-two using gdb to view the assembly instruction, you may notice the puts, strdup, exit and gets function calls with parameters. So basically when you hit `r` in gdb without breakpoint,

- The program initializes auth and service to null pointers.
- The program prints out a banner message using printf.
- The program enters a while loop that runs continuously until the user stops the program.
- Within the loop, the program prints out the current values of auth and service using printf.
- The program reads a line of input from the user using fgets.
- The program checks if the input string starts with the string "auth ".
   - If it does, the program allocates memory for a new auth struct using malloc, initializes it with zeros using memset, and stores the user's name in the name field of the auth struct using strcpy.
   - The program checks if the input string starts with the string "reset".
   - If it does, the program frees the memory allocated for the auth struct using free.
- The program checks if the input string starts with the string "service".
   - If it does, the program allocates memory for a new char array using strdup and stores the service name in it.
   - The program checks if the input string starts with the string "login".
   - If it does and auth is not null and auth->auth is true, the program prints out a message saying that the user has already logged in.
   - If it does and auth is null or auth->auth is false, the program prints out a message asking the user to enter their password.
- The program repeats steps 4-9 until the user stops the program by closing the command-line interface.

### Primary Goal

This is a fairly simple challenge and primary goal is to leverage buffer overflow and overwrite the auth->auth variable to 1. Additionally, use Use-After-Free to force the program to re-allocate the memory for the auth struct and overwrite the auth->name pointer to point to the service buffer. This will allow us to overwrite the auth->auth variable without having to enter a password.

### Memory Allocation

#### Buffer Overflow

The service buffer is allocated on the heap using strdup. The strdup function is similar to the strcpy function, except that it allocates memory for the destination string using malloc. So, you could use `service <OVERFLOW_BUFFER_STRING>` to overflow the service buffer.

#### Use-After-Free

If you take closer look at the lifecycle of the program (infinite while loop), you could potentially call `free(auth)` and `login` could use the same `auth` object to make the login decision. So, if you could overwrite the `auth->auth` variable to 1, you could potentially login without entering the password. The `free` method doesn't actually free the memory, it just marks the memory as free and the content remains the same.

#### Exploit Strategy,

1. Allocate memory for auth struct using `auth test`
2. Free the memory using `reset`
   - This will mark the memory as free, but the content remains the same.
3. Allocate memory for service buffer using `service <OVERFLOW_BUFFER_STRING>`
   - Since `strdup` dynamically allocates buffer in runtime to copy the characters, when the `malloc` request memory, 
   it will allocate the memory in the same address as the `auth` struct.
   - So, the `auth->name` pointer will point to the `service` buffer.
   - You could calculate the size of auth object roughly `32 Bytes char` + `4 Bytes Int` which is helpful to come up with the overflow string.
4. Login using `login`
   - Since the `auth->auth` variable is set to 1, the program will print the message `you have logged in already!` and 
   the program will exit.


### Exploit

So, the final exploit would be as follows,

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$ ./heap-two
Welcome to phoenix/heap-two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
[ auth = 0, service = 0 ]
auth test
[ auth = 0x600e40, service = 0 ]
reset
[ auth = 0x600e40, service = 0 ]
serviceaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1
[ auth = 0x600e40, service = 0x600e40 ]  --> auth->name pointer points to service buffer
login
you have logged in already!
[ auth = 0x600e40, service = 0x600e40 ]
```

There you go! 🎉 You've officially `pwned` the `binary` and possibly you could control the program flow and may eventually 
perform code execution in the system. 🪲
