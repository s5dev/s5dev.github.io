title: Detecting Content Provider API Access with Semgrep Rules

description: Content provider APIs are powerful way to expose data to internal or external apps within Android ecosystem. However, there are lot of ways these APIs are implemented with flaws that leads to serious data leakage and even Remote code execution.

If you ask any professional Android engineer (including me) about Content Provider, they would get excited about implementing Content Provider CRUD queries just be extending a class and implementing those methods and accessing via URI (example: `android://com.zoho.example/database/:_data`). Though these Content Provider is a cupcake for developers, Unfortunately there are track records of vulnerabilities within those APIs and with implementation part. 

The main trigger for writing this post are Semgrep and recent blog post from `project zero` regarding [Analysis of a Samsung in-the-wild exploit chain](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/11/a-very-powerful-clipboard-samsung-in-the-wild-exploit-chain.html). I've been using semgrep for a while to tweak my findings instead of naive grep and the other one may look trivial but how a simple permission bypass can affect system level apps in the Android phone.

### Quick Overview

Content providers has various vulnerability patterns (not an exhaustive list) that includes,

1. arbitrary read & write into app sandbox 
2. arbitrary SQL queries
3. exported content providers
4. exposed content provider <= API 16 (Jelly Bean) 
5. exposed content provider > API 23 when compiled against API 16 (reported by me around 2019) 

and even more üî•

In this post, we'll take a look at `arbitrary read & write into app sandbox` which means a exported content provider allows arbitrary file read and write within the app sandbox.

### Source and Sink

The source would be `OpenFile(Uri, String)` and sink is `openFileHelper(Uri, String)`
