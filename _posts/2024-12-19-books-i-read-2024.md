### Books

If you’re looking for a great device to read books, highlight important sections, and take notes, the [Kindle Scribe](https://www.amazon.ca/Introducing-Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-and-writing/dp/B09BS5XWNS) is a fantastic option. It’s especially handy for times like waiting at the airport/hospital, traveling by flight/train.

Pro tip: You can always send pdf/epub to kindle and read it on kindle.
