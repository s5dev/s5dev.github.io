Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack is one my favourite vulnerability category as it's quite easy to exploit by checking for params as source and rendering DOM as sink.

### Problem

The core problem of Reflected Cross-Site scripting attack is appending the URL parameter values in the DOM without validation or filtering. Though the reflected XSS requires user interaction by visiting the page or clicking on links in real life attacks, peoples should think about Iframe tags which doesn't require any interaction to load them on other third party web pages.

Cutting to the chase, Leetcode submission page has interesting parameter in the url as "from" which contains URI that's used by problem statement button. This button helps in navigating the user back to the problem statement seamlessly. The problem is that leetcode developers appended the from url parameter value in the href tag without validation. This triggered XSS on \*.leetcode.com.

payload : https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/415518712/?from=javascript:alert(document.domain)///explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/9298/

#### Mitigation:

1. A simple fix would be constructing the url with http/https and block javascript or custom uri origin.
2. [Attribute based encoding](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts) to prevent XSS.

### Timeline:

1. Reported - Nov 2, 2020
2. Acknowledged on Nov 3, 2020
3. Fixes rolled out on ~Dec 5, 2020
