Exploit.education binary exploitation excercise typically runs on ASLR (Address space layout randomization) disabled ubuntu based virtual machine with Data Execution Prevention turned off binaries. In order to setup the `exploit.education` lab, You'll have to either use virtualbox or qemu based virtual machine emulator setup to easily test and debug the exercises.

### Installation

For both MacOS and Windows, grab a copy of [qemu emulator](https://www.qemu.org/download/) and follow the installation setup which is quite easy.

### Virtual Machine Setup

Grab a copy of [Phoenix Qemu Image](https://exploit.education/downloads/) based on your system arch (most probably amd64) and follow the instruction below,

#### MacOS Setup
1. `tar xJf exploit-education-phoenix-amd64-v1.0.0-alpha-3.tar.xz`
2. `cd exploit-education-phoenix-amd64/`
3. `./boot-exploit-education-phoenix-amd64.sh` (after chmod u+x)

#### Windows Setup
1. On Windows, you could unzip using `winzip` or `7z`
2. `cd exploit-education-phoenix-amd64/`
3. Right click on `boot.ps1` > `Run with Powershell` 

(or)

1. execute on Command Prompt 

```shell
> qemu-system-x86_64.exe -kernel vmlinuz-4.9.0-8-amd64 -initrd initrd.img-4.9.0-8-amd64 -append "root=/dev/vda1" -m 2048M -netdev user,id=unet,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22 -device virtio-net,netdev=unet -drive file=exploit-education-phoenix-amd64.qcow2,if=virtio,format=qcow2,index=0
```

#### SSH Setup

You can use your favourite ssh applications such as PuTTY or plain terminal would do this job,

1. `ssh -p2222 user@localhost` 

As published on `exploit.education` website, password for `user:user` and `root:root`

### Playground

You can headover to `/opt/phoenix/amd64` to start playing around the with the binaries üéâ
